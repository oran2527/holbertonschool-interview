Sandpiles - Numberphile
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sandpiles.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Tasks
0. Sandpiles sum
mandatory
Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);
You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
You’re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
